Description: Comparison of circulating monocytes from pre- and postmenopausal females 
with low or high bone mineral density (BMD). Circulating monocytes are progenitors of 
osteoclasts, and produce factors important to bone metabolism. Results provide insight
into the role of monocytes in osteoporosis.(DataSet Record GDS1287 from NCBI;
